# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian vault containing academic research documentation, lab notes, and personal knowledge management. The vault focuses on robotics research, particularly air-water transition vehicles, bio-inspired robots (mudskipper, squid), and related engineering projects including DARPA demonstrations.

## Vault Structure

- **LabNote/**: Experimental logs, calculations, and technical documentation from lab work
- **Paper Review/**: Academic paper analysis organized by research area (Collective Behavior, FSI, Robotics/Air-water)
- **Paper plot/**: Research project planning and grant proposal notes
- **Spiritual/**: Personal content (biblical lectures, messages)
- **Todo list.md**: Active project tasks and shopping lists for lab equipment

## Content Patterns and Conventions

### Academic Paper Reviews
- Follow structured format: Motivation → Contents → Key findings
- Use bullet-point hierarchies for clear organization
- Include technical terms and applications in context
- Reference specific research gaps and future directions

### Lab Notes
- Include quantitative data, calculations, and parameter tables
- Document experimental setups with specific measurements (e.g., nozzle thickness, Young's modulus)
- Use markdown tables for data organization
- Track iterative improvements and test results

### Project Management
- Todo items organized by project (Mudskipper, DARPA Robotics, DARPA Propeller)
- Split tasks between "Home" and "Lab" activities
- Track equipment procurement with links and status updates
- Maintain reimbursement tracking

## Key Research Areas

1. **Bio-inspired Robotics**: Mudskipper-inspired amphibious robots with propeller systems
2. **Air-Water Transition Vehicles**: UAAVs (Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles) and control challenges
3. **Fluid Structure Interaction**: Squid-inspired jet propulsion and nozzle dynamics
4. **Experimental Validation**: Lab testing of prototypes with thrust measurements and PIV analysis

## Technical Context

- Research involves mechanical design, 3D printing, circuit development (Arduino, MPU6050, motor drivers)
- Experimental work includes pump testing, silicon molding, and fluid mechanics measurements
- Cross-disciplinary approach combining robotics, fluid dynamics, and bio-inspiration
- Active collaboration with DARPA projects and academic research

## Note-Taking Philosophy

The vault follows a research-oriented structure where each note serves as either:
- A literature review component for understanding existing work
- An experimental log for tracking progress and results
- A planning document for future work and resource allocation

When working with this vault, maintain the established academic rigor while supporting the practical engineering development workflow.
