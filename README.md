## 📋 Project Overview

**FlowSwarm** addresses a fundamental gap in collective behavior research by investigating how animals navigate and coordinate in complex fluid environments. The project combines:

- **Bio-inspired Robotics** - Amphibious swarms based on mudskipper locomotion
- **Virtual Reality Systems** - Immersive multi-sensory experimental environments  
- **Flow Dynamics** - Integration with large-scale currents and turbulence
- **Collective Intelligence** - Extension of classical Vicsek models

## 🎯 Key Innovations

1. **🧠 Cognitive Flow Models** - First integration of flow sensing with cognitive decision-making
2. **🥽 Immersive VR Methods** - Novel VR-flow laboratory for multi-sensory experiments
3. **🤖 Bio-Inspired Validation** - Robotic swarms for real-world testing
4. **🌊 Multi-Scale Integration** - Linking individual sensing to group patterns

## 📊 Interactive Features

The visualization includes:

- **Dynamic Timeline** - 24-month project development phases
- **Interactive Network** - Research integration diagram with D3.js
- **Impact Analysis** - Sunburst chart of scientific/technological/societal impacts
- **Budget Breakdown** - Visual funding allocation
- **Phase Explorer** - Click through Theory, VR Lab, and Bio-Robotics phases

## 🔬 Research Context

This work builds upon:
- Recent findings by Sayin et al. (2025) on visual cues in collective behavior
- Classical Vicsek models of swarm dynamics
- Bio-inspired amphibious robotics research
- DARPA projects on air-water transition vehicles
