## Project Title
**FlowSwarm: Understanding Collective Animal Behavior in Complex Flow Fields through Bio-Inspired Robotics and Immersive Virtual Reality**

## Abstract
This interdisciplinary project addresses a fundamental gap in collective behavior research: how animals navigate and coordinate in complex fluid environments. While recent work by Sayin et al. (2025) highlights the importance of visual cues in collective behavior, flow dynamics play an equally crucial role in natural swarms, particularly for fish and birds. This project proposes a novel approach combining bio-inspired robotics, advanced flow visualization, and immersive virtual reality to understand how individual sensory processing and group dynamics interact with large-scale flow structures.

## Excellence

### Research Objectives
1. **Mechanistic Understanding**: Investigate how individual animals integrate flow sensory information with visual and social cues during collective behavior
2. **Multi-Scale Modeling**: Develop computational models linking individual decision-making to emergent group patterns in complex flow fields
3. **Bio-Inspired Applications**: Create amphibious robotic swarms capable of coordinating in air-water transition zones

### Scientific Approach

#### Phase 1: Flow-Integrated Collective Behavior Analysis
- Extend the Vicsek model framework to include flow field interactions
- Analyze how flow gradients, turbulence, and large-scale currents influence swarm cohesion and decision-making
- Compare visual-only models (Sayin et al.) with flow-integrated models using existing collective behavior datasets

#### Phase 2: Immersive VR Flow Laboratory
- Design and build a multi-sensory VR system integrating:
  - High-resolution flow visualization using particle tracking velocimetry
  - Haptic feedback systems for flow sensation
  - Multi-agent interaction protocols
- Validate virtual flow fields against physical experiments using wind/water tunnels

#### Phase 3: Bio-Inspired Robotic Implementation
- Develop amphibious robot swarms based on mudskipper locomotion principles
- Implement flow-sensing capabilities using pressure arrays and accelerometers
- Test collective navigation strategies in controlled air-water environments

*Research Notes:*
- Visual sense is important in [[Sayin ... Couzin et al 2025 Science]]
- but flow is obviously crucial in their formation especially in fish and bird 
- flow generator with immersive VR system?
- interaction of swarm and large scale flow structure (like current and cloud-scale wind)
